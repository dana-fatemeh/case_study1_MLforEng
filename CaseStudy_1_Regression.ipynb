        "**Background:** There are gas phase and liquid slurry reactors that create polymers (polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and others) from chemical building blocks known as monomers (C2=, C3=, C4=, iC5=, and others). A catalyst is injected with the monomers under carefully controlled temperature and pressure conditions to cause a reaction that grows the polymer chains. Hydrogen is a chain transfer agent to stop the growth of the polymer chain. If the polymer chains grow too long then the polymer is too viscous for manufacturing in films, injection molding, or other applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "This case study focuses on measurements of Melt Flow Rate (MFR) to determine the polymer viscosity based on reactor conditions. An accurate model is desirable so that the infrequent lab samples (every 2-8 hours) are supplemented with a virtual and continuous \"soft sensor\". A model that runs in real-time simulation alongside the physical reactor is called a digital twin.\n",

        "Part 1: 𝑅^2 tells us how much of the variation in the real target values (MFR) is explained by the model. An 𝑅^2 of 1 means the model explains everything perfectly, 0 means it's no better than just predicting the average, and it can even be negative if the model is worse than that baseline.\n",
        "MSE (mean squared error) is the average of (prediction − true)^2. It directly measures how far predictions are from the real values, and smaller is better. Because it squares the errors, it also punishes large mistakes more. In practice, both are useful, but if we want to understand how wrong our predictions are in a concrete way, MSE is usually more informative because it directly reflects prediction error size. 𝑅^2 is helpful as a quick explanation summary, but it doesn't tell you the real error magnitude.\n",

        "Part 2: When we try different sets of variables, the performance changes. Some combinations give a higher 𝑅^2 and lower MSE (better), and some give a lower 𝑅^2 and higher MSE (worse). In general, variables that have a real relationship with MFR improve the results, while weak or noisy variables don't help much and can sometimes make test performance worse. Also, adding more variables does not always improve the model. If the new variables don't add new information or they are redundant, the improvement can be small.\n"

If a row was an outlier in any variable, We removed that row.

        "We tried predicting a transformed version of MFR using transformed inputs, and it worked better than using only the original variables in a plain linear model. We used a log transform on the target with log1p(MFR) and tested a few transformed inputs such as log1p(Pressure), log1p(H2R), squared terms like Pressure^2, and interaction terms like Pressure*H2R. The model usually performed better when the transformations made the relationships more linear and reduced the effect of extreme values. The best results came from a small mix of log and interaction features, not from adding too many random transforms. When we added too many transformed features, the model became less stable and sometimes test performance dropped, which suggests mild overfitting. So our main observation is that transformations can help a lot, but only when they are chosen based on data behavior and not added blindly."

The dataset is not one clean straight line pattern, so one global line does a bad job. That is why the full dataset result looks terrible, while each subset gives much smaller error.\n",

So the huge change in R^2 and mse is caused by both data structure and evaluation inconsistency.\n",

        "We trained the models on 1617 samples and evaluated on 412 test samples. Based on 5 fold cross validation, KNN with k equals 7 was clearly the best model. It had the highest average R^2 at about 0.786 and the lowest average MSE around 4.88. The other models were noticeably weaker, with R^2 values around 0.63 for linear methods and about 0.67 for the decision tree. After selecting KNN from cross validation and testing it once on the untouched test set, it still performed well with test R^2 of 0.7288 and test MSE of 6.0910. We also repeated cross validation with different random splits, and the scores changed a little each time, which is expected. The KNN average R^2 stayed in a narrow range around 0.776 to 0.788 and MSE stayed around 4.85 to 5.10, so the model looks fairly stable. This shows why trying different splits matters, because one split alone can be misleading, while repeated cross validation gives a more reliable picture of performance."
